    "## The MARC21 character model\n",
    "\n",
    "When Unicode was adopted as an encoding option for MARC21, a key criteria was the ability to round trip data between the MARC-8 encoding and Unicode. The mapping table mapped the atomic MARC-8 characters to their direct counterparts in Unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "MARC-8 made extensive use of non-spacing diacritics. These diacritics were placed before the base character and were positioned according to their relative positioning in the typographic character space moving from highest to lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode on the other hand places combining diacritics after the base character and the diacritics follow a cannonical ordering, opposite to MARC-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between MARC21 character model and Unicode Normalization Form D (NFD) is that MARC21 treats some base character and diacritic combinations as base characters in and of themselves. The consequence is that bibliographic data that follows the MARC21 character model does not match any of the Unicode Normalization Forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some library software will generate bibliographic records that follow the MARC21 character model, while others will normalize data based on one of the Unicode Normalization Forms. If you include the use of copy cataloguing and the bulk importation of bibliographic records, or the differening conversion routines for MARC8 to Unicode, the state of a database becomes fluid. It is possible to observe NFC, NFD and MARC21 normalised data, as well as unnormalised data, within the same databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard programming and scripting tools and libraries support the Unicode normalisation forms. It is uncommon to find tools and libraries that can normalise data according to the MARC21 character model."
